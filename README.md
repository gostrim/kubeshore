# Kubeshore
Kubeshore is a Kafka operator for k8s

## Why
There are opensource version of operators but it was either too complex or too simple.

We wanted something that is simple enough to use but be able use it in production envrionment.

## Goal
Create a Kafka cluster with monitoring and UI interface that could be used to manage topics.
